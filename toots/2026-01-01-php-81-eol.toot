🥳 Happy New Year! As 2025 fades into the past, it's time to say goodbye to our old friend PHP 8.1.

🏅 PHP 8.1 pushed the language forward, introducing enums, readonly properties, first-class callable syntax, fibers, intersection types, and more.

🪦 Now, PHP 8.1 has reached its end-of-life. Raise a glass of your choosing and bid farewell to this titan of PHP history. 🥂

⬆️ All users of PHP 8.1 are encouraged to upgrade to a supported version. https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php

#PHP #EOL
