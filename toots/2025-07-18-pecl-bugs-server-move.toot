The infrastructure team is in the progress of moving all PHP related services and servers to a new Ansible managed infrastructure.

This month, we moved over:

📦 https://pecl.php.net — at some point we will be phasing out PECL for PIE, the website should be a lot snappier now.

🐞 https://bugs.php.net — mostly visited by bots, we still would need to preserve it for historical context.
