üêò We recently introduced WASM runnable-examples in the manual.

An example: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.assignment.php

We only enabled it for sections where we know the examples work, as they were not always written with runability in mind.

‚ÑπÔ∏è We need to evaluate each section on https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues/4799, and verify the examples, whether they need a fix, or need other tweaks to make it work.

For the random extension, this is what I did: https://github.com/php/doc-en/commit/1bcc40f8134305cbebf6c8378ee7e5fc8c569674

‚ùì Will you help?
